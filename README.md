# CarbonFootprintEstimator
🌿 MoodPrint: My Carbon Project!

🧑‍💻 What It Is

Hey! This is my Introduction to Problem Solving (Python) project.

The goal is easy: it helps you find your monthly pollution score (carbon footprint) just by asking simple questions.

The whole project uses basic Python tools: lists, functions, and dictionaries.

✨ What It Does (The 3 Parts)

The program has three main jobs:

Ask Questions: This part takes your input. It has simple code to stop the program from crashing if you type the wrong thing (like a letter instead of a number!).

Do the Math: This part uses the numbers in factors.py to calculate your score for Transport, Diet, and Energy.

Give Advice: It prints your final score, tells you your biggest problem area, and gives you a simple tip to fix it.

🛠️ What I Used

Language: Python 3

Skills: Functions, Data Lists (Dictionaries/Lists), File Reading, and basic error-stopping code.

Source Control: Git.


1. Stop the Crash

Test: Try to make it fail (e.g., type a word like banana when asked for distance).

Result: It must NOT crash! It should just ask the question again.

2. Check the Math

Test: Make sure the score is correct.

How: Check the numbers in factors.py. (Example: CAR + 1 km daily should equal $6 \text{ kg} \text{ CO}_{2}\text{e}$ monthly).

Result: The program's final number must match your simple math check.
